Overview:
Our application is a game sharing site. 
At its most fundamental level it provides a platform for users to sell or rent games
to those interested in them. A common scenario for people playing video games, 
known as gamers hereafter, is that they accumulate a collection of games that 
they no longer wish to play. Typically, this is due to the fact that the gamer 
has completed said game but it may also be due to simple dislike. Regardless of
the reason, a gamer typically builds a significant collection of these games,
with the most prolific gamers having collections of upwards of a hundred games. 
At this point in time, these games hold little value to the gamer herself but may 
represent a significant value for someone who has not played the game. In this
fashion, our site hopes to capitalize on the unused collections of games that people
possess by allowing said people to sell or rent these games to people who have an 
interest in them. Our site provides a marketplace for games, allowing users to 
quickly and easily sell, rent or purchase games.
